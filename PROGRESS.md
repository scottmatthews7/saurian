# Progress

## Done (session 1)
- **Engine:** Babylon.js 8.x vendored in `lib/` (no build step). See `DECISIONS.md`.
- **Assets:** 6 CC0 Quaternius animated dino glbs in `assets/models/`.
- **World** (`src/world.js`): procedural rolling terrain + hill rim, hemi+directional
  light, soft shadows, exp2 fog, gradient skydome, day/night cycle, instanced trees/
  rocks/grass (collisions on big ones).
- **Player/AI/Eggs/Game/HUD/Config** scaffolded and wired (see git history).

## Done (session 2)
- **CRITICAL FIX — player movement was broken.** Player root is a `TransformNode`,
  which has no `moveWithCollisions`/`ellipsoid`, so the session-1 controller silently
  failed: the raptor never moved. Now drives an invisible collider box and copies its
  position onto the visual root each frame (`player.warpTo` avoids first-frame pop).
- **Facing confirmed.** Empirical probe: raptor travels +Z exactly matching its yaw
  (`forwardDotTravel = 1.0`). `FACING_OFFSET` per-species map added in `config.js`
  (all 0 — correct); flip any entry to `Math.PI` if a model ever runs backwards.
- **Audio** (`src/audio.js`): zero-asset procedural WebAudio — roar, bite, pickup,
  bank, footstep, hurt, win, lose, evolving ambient drone, and a proximity **tension
  heartbeat** that speeds up as the chasing T-Rex closes. Mute via button + M key.
  Unlocked on first gesture (autoplay policy).
- **Juice** (`src/fx.js`): footstep dust particles, egg pickup/bank/drop bursts,
  camera shake on hits, low-health red vignette (HUD), emissive hit-flash on any
  struck dino (`dino.flash` in `dino.js`).
- **Minimap** (`src/minimap.js`): top-down radar canvas — player facing wedge, T-Rex
  (red when chasing), herd (blue when fleeing), eggs, nest ring.
- **Compass + timer** on the objective pill: view-relative arrow to the nearest egg
  (or nest when carrying) + elapsed run time.
- **Balance pass:** sprint **stamina** (drain/regen + exhaustion lockout, HUD bar);
  **carry-slow** (eggs weigh you down); **drop-egg-on-hit** (a T-Rex bite fumbles an
  egg back into the valley); **Triceratops charge-back** (cornered trike charges the
  player for contact damage on a cooldown).
- **Carried-egg visuals:** eggs hover/bob over the raptor's back while carried.
- **Pause** (P, gates the sim + banner). **Best clear time** saved to localStorage,
  shown on the win banner.
- All tunables centralised in `config.js` (FACING_OFFSET, JUICE, AUDIO, MINIMAP,
  TRICERATOPS, stamina/carry under PLAYER) — no scattered magic numbers.

## Verified (session 2)
- All 12 src modules pass `node --check`.
- Three independent in-browser smokes on my own tabs (port 8124): **0 console errors**,
  ~95-103 FPS foreground (30-49 when backgrounded/throttled), 460 meshes.
  - Movement + facing: raptor moves ~6.5 u/s along +Z, dot=1.0.
  - Carry visual enables on pickup (egg disabled); pause banner toggles on P.
  - Egg pickup/drop/bank loop **unit-tested headless in Node** (stubbed Babylon):
    pickup→carry, drop restores a collectible egg, bank marks+clears+callbacks,
    `remaining()` correct, empty drop returns false.

## Known environment issue (unchanged from s1, now worse)
- The machine's Chrome is shared by several parallel Claude instances ("dinob" on
  ports 8000/8333/8411). They navigate ANY tab I open — even isolated browser
  contexts — within 1-2 seconds. **Live cinematic screenshots are not obtainable.**
  Worked around it with atomic init-script probes + single-eval captures (data is
  grabbed before hijack) and curl integrity checks (`curl :8124` confirms MY files
  are served). The deterministic Node test + scene-inspection smokes are the source
  of truth, not screenshots.

## Next (session 3)
- **Beauty screenshot** when peers are idle (or use a private Chrome profile / a
  different port the others don't probe). Confirm each species' scale/ground contact
  visually; tune `heights` in `ai.js` and the player `PLAYER.height` if any float/sink.
- **Herbivore collisions:** AI dinos currently walk through trees/rocks (they set
  position directly, no `moveWithCollisions`). Fine for arcade feel; upgrade if desired.
- **Multiple T-Rexes on later waves** (stretch from s1) — spawn a 2nd predator at a
  high wave for escalating pressure.
- **More biomes / egg types** (e.g. a rare high-value egg), score multiplier for fast
  banking, combo for back-to-back deliveries.
- **Mobile/touch controls** if targeting phones (currently keyboard + mouse only).
- Consider a proper title screen with a START button (the parallel "dinob" build has
  one; ours starts on first input — both fine).

## Run it
```
cd /Users/scottmatthews/personal_repos/dino-arena-a
python3 -m http.server 8124
# open http://localhost:8124/
# Controls: WASD move · Shift sprint · Space jump · Click/J bite · M mute · P pause · R restart
```

## Debug harness
Append `?probe`/`?smoke` to the URL — the init scripts used this session auto-start
and auto-move so a single `evaluate_script` can read `window.__probeResult` before any
peer hijacks the tab. Re-paste from git history of this file's prior version if needed.
